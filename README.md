# Simple Stack Plugin
Simple Stack is a plugin designed to make all items stack to 64. No permissions are required to make Simple Stack work, 
just install the plugin to your server and run!

:warning: This plugin has not been tested on large servers or with other plugins! Please do proper testing before 
deploying this plugin on your server! If you find a bug or want to suggest a new feature, please report it to
the issues tab in this Github repository.

:warning: Note: Simple Stack does not currently work in the creative inventory. This is because the creative inventory 
works differently from the normal inventories (Survival inventory, chest inventory, etc). To stack normally unstackable 
items in creative mode, open any other inventory besides the creative inventory like a chest or furnace.

### How to Use

After installing this plugin on a server items that didn't previously stack to 64 can now be stacked to 64
simply by moving items around the inventory and combining them into a stack.
