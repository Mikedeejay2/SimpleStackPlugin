Development branch for Simple Stack v2.0. For latest development builds, visit the 
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Mikedeejay2/SimpleStackPlugin/actions) for this project.

Simple Stack is a plugin designed to make all items stack to 64. No permissions are required to make Simple Stack work,
just install the plugin to your server and run!

### About Future Updates
Update 2.0 is in the works, but it is going to take time. Because of limited time constraints and the state of the
Simple Stack v1.x codebase, bug patches for the current versions will *not* be happening. Some bug fixes that aren't in
version 1.3.8 can still be found in the master/stable branch. These fixes are compilable but, as with all previous
versions of Simple Stack, could include bugs.

### Translating
Translating this plugin into other languages is going to be managed on a Discord server once the 2.0
update is finished. Alternatively, a pull request can be submitted to update a language file.
