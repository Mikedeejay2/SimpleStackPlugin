Simple Stack is a plugin designed to make all items stack to 64. No permissions are required to make Simple Stack work, 
just install the plugin to your server and run!

⚠️ Note: Simple Stack does not currently work in the creative inventory. This is because the creative inventory works 
differently from the normal inventories (Survival inventory, chest inventory, etc). To stack normally unstackable items 
in creative mode, open any other inventory besides the creative inventory like a chest or furnace.

### How to Use

After installing this plugin on a server items that didn't previously stack to 64 can now be stacked to 64
simply by moving items around the inventory and combining them into a stack.

Item Types: Item types that will or will not be stacked to 64 based on the list mode above

Item Amounts: Set the amount of items that an item of that type can hold.
Note: Items in item amounts must also be in the items list if in whitelist mode

Hopper Movement Checks: Hoppers will attempt to stack unstackable items together.
Setting this to false will stop hopper checks which could increase performance but will
Stop stacking of unstackables when moving through hoppers.

Ground Stacking Checks: Simple Stack will check whether unstackable items on the ground
will stack together or not.
Setting this to false will stop unstackables stacking when on the ground and could
increase performance at the cost of unstackables not stacking when on the ground.
